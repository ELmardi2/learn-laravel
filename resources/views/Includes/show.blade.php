      Before you can begin writing, you need to know what you are writing about. First, look at the writing prompt
      or assignment topic. As you look at the prompt, note any key terms or repeated phrases because you will
      want to use those words in your response. Then ask yourself:
      • On what topic am I supposed to be writing?
      • What do I know about this topic already?
      • If I don’t know how to respond to this assignment, where can I go to find some answers?
      • What does this assignment mean to me? How do I relate to it?
